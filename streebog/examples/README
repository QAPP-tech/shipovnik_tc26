Examples for GOST R 34.11-2012 hash function
============================================

M1, M2: Example messages as per standard.

M3: Empty message.

M4: 64-bytes of zeros.

Results for each message are in H*.{256,512} files respectively. For example,
512-bit hash for M1 is in H1.512. For message M4 result of 256-bit hash
function is in H4.256. Results are presented in hexadecimal format with least
significant byte first. Use -e switch to obtain reversed output which is used
in standard.

Hashes for M1 and M2 can be obtained from standard or RFC[1]. Results for
messages M3 and M4 are not publicly available. I got them from trusted source.
